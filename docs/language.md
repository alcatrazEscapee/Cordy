# Cordy Language

Cordy is a dynamically typed, interpreted, semi-functional / semi-procedural language, designed to be fast to write for scripting and solving puzzles. Its design is inspired by parts of Python, Rust, Haskell, Java, Haskell, and JavaScript.

This document should give a comprehensive overview of how the language of Cordy is defined, from a perspective of some prior programming experience.


### Types

The primitive types in Cordy are:

- `nil` (The absence of a value)
- A boolean (`bool`), which can take the values `true` and `false`.
- `int`, which is a 63-bit integer. It can be expressed as decimal numbers (`5`), binary (`0b101`), or hexadecimal (`0x5`).
- `complex`, which is a pair of 64-bit integers, with a real and imaginary part. Imaginary int literals can be expressed as any integer literal followed by an `i` or `j`.
- `str`, which is a UTF-8 string. Like Python, there is no separate `char` data type, instead a string is a sequence of single element strings.

All primitive types are **immutable**. In addition to these, Cordy has a number of [Collection Types](#collection-types), and allows the creation of basic user defined types in the form of [Structs](#structs).

### Expressions

Expressions in Cordy are similar to C style languages. Cordy has a number of mathematical operators:

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
  - Note: multiplying a `str` and an `int` repeats the string by the int number of times, as in Python.
  - Note: addition with `str` will convert other arguments to a string and concatenate them.
  - `/` for integers and complex numbers is floor division, rounding to negative infinity.
- `a ** b` computes a raised to the power of b.
- `a % b` computes the mathematical modulo `a mod b`, and will always return a value in `[0, b)`.
  - When `a` is a string, this behaves like Python's string formatting `%` operator.
- `&`, `|`, and `^` are bitwise AND, OR, and XOR, respectively. `<<` and `>>` are left and right shifts.
  - Shifts be negative values shift in reverse, so `1 >> -3` is `8`.
- `!` computes a logical not of boolean inputs, or a bitwise not of integer inputs.
- `and` and `or` are short-circuiting, logical operators.
- `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=` compare values. Any values, regardless of types, can be compared for equality or ordering.
  - Note: different types will always compare as equal ordering.
  - Chained comparison operators behave intuitively like in Python: `a < b < c` is equivalent to `(a < b) and (b < c)` (without evaluating `b` twice).
- `if condition then value_if_true else value_if_false` is a short-circuiting ternary operator.
  - Note that all boolean comparisons will take the truthy value of its argument. `nil`, `0`, `false`, `''`, empty collections, and empty `range` and `enumerate` types are the only falsy values, everything else is truthy.
- `is` (along with `is not`) is an operator used to check if a value (left hand operand) is of a given type (right hand operand).
- `in` (along with `not in`) is a special operator used for checking membership in collections, or substrings.
- `max=` and `min=` are special cases of the builtin functions `max` and `min`, expressed as an assignment operator. `a max= b` is semantically equivalent to `a = if b > a then b else a`, similar for `min=`.


All the above binary operators come in operator-equals variants: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

All operators are left associative (except `=` for assigning variables). Their precedence is noted as below, where higher entries are higher precedence:

| Precedence | Operators                                                                                      | Description                                                                            |

### Variables

Variables must be declared with `let`. They can optionally be followed by a initialization.

```rust
// A variable declaration, it is initialized to `nil`
let x

// A variable declaration and assignment
let y = 'hello'
```

Variable declarations can be chained:

```rust
let x, y, z
```

Even with assignments:

```rust
let x = 1, y = 2, z = 3
```

### Functions

Cordy has functions as a first class type, so they can be declared anywhere. It also supports anonymous (lambda) functions which can be used as part of expressions. A function begins with `fn`, followed by a name (if it is not an anonymous function), and then the function body:

```rust
// the most basic function, `foo`, which does nothing
fn foo() {}

// this is an anonymous function, assigned to the variable `f`
let f = fn() {}

// this is a function which is immediately evaluated
(fn() { ... })()
```

The body of a function can either be a block statement (a series of statements wrapped in `{` curly `}` brackets), or it can be an arrow `->` followed by a single expression.

A function will return the last expression present in the function, or whenever a `return` keyword is reached.

```rust
// these functions are semantically equivalent
fn three() { 
    3
}

fn three() { 
    return 3
}

fn three() -> 3
```

#### Native and Operator Functions

Cordy has a number of [Native Functions](./stdlib.md), which can be used as normal functions. In addition to these, each operator is also a function, which can be referenced by placing it in `(` parentheses `)`.

```rust
let addition = (+)
```

Note in some cases the additional parenthesis can be omitted, for instance if passing an operator to a function:

```python
>>> print(+)
(+)
```

One such important native function is `print`, which prints all arguments, space separated, to standard out, followed by a newline:

```rust
// rite of passage!
print('hello world!')
```

In addition, special types can be written for writing indexing and slicing. A list with one integral element can be used as a function to index with that element, and slice literals can be written, which can be used as functions to perform slicing operations:

```rust
// Indexes 'foo' at index 'bar'
foo . [bar]

// Slices 'foo' with the given slice
foo . [2:4]
```

#### Function Evaluation

Functions can be invoked in two ways. First, in a C-style function invocation, the function name and passing arguments within brackets:

```rust
// calls the function foo with the arguments 1, 2
foo(1, 2)
```

Alternatively, single-argument functions can be invoked with the `.` operator, which reverses the order of function and argument:

```rust
// same as writing foo('hello')
'hello' . foo
```

Finally, functions can also be evaluated, one argument at a time, left associatively, simply by adjacent whitespace (but not newline!) separated arguments after the function:

```rust
// same as writing `foo(1)(2)(3)`, which is the same as `foo(1, 2, 3)` if `foo` returns partial functions for the first two arguments
foo 1 2 3
```

Note that this is not always possible, and if it would be ambiguous with some other syntax, that is universally preferred. For example:

```rust
foo [1] // Evaluates to `foo[1]`, not `foo([1])`
foo [1, 2] // Syntax error - not a valid index or slice.
```

#### Partial Functions

Functions can be *partially evaluated*, that is, if a function is evaluated with less than the required number of arguments, it returns a new function which can be evaluated with the remaining arguments:

```rust
// foo takes three arguments
fn foo(a, b, c) {}

// this creates a partial function...
let partial_foo = foo(1, 2)

// ...which only needs the third argument
partial_foo(3)
```

Operators can also be partially evaluated, and like above, the parenthesis can be omitted around the operator:

```rust
let add3 = (+3)
add3(4) // returns 7
```

Note that function evaluation with `()` is high precedence, whereas function evaluation with `.` is low precedence. This can be used alongside partial functions to great effect:

```cpp
// Note that
input . map(int)

// is the same as
map(int, input)

// but the former is more readable in long statements, for example:
input . map(int) . filter(>0) . reduce(+) . print
```

#### More Function Syntax

Functions can define optional and default arguments. All optional and default arguments must come after all other arguments in the function. Functions can be invoked with or without their optional or default arguments, which will take the default value `nil` (for optional arguments), or the default value (for default arguments).

Optional arguments are declared by appending a `?` to the argument in the function declaration:

```rust
fn optional_argument(a, b?) -> print(a, b)

optional_argument('hello') // prints 'hello nil'
optional_argument('hello', 'world') // prints 'hello world'
```

Default arguments are declared by appending an `=` followed by an expression to the argument in the function declaration:

```rust
fn default_argument(a, b = 'world') -> print(a, b)

default_argument('hello') // prints 'hello world'
default_argument('hello', 'earth') // prints 'hello earth'
```

Note that default argument values are constructed each time, and are not mutable across function calls, unlike in Python:

```rust
fn foo(a = []) {
    a.push('yes')
    print(a)
}

foo() // prints ['yes']
foo() // prints ['yes']
```

Functions can be called with **unrolled arguments**. This unrolls an iterable into a sequence of function arguments, by prepending a `...` to the argument in question. This is like the unary `*` operator in Python:

```rust
fn foo(a, b, c) -> print(a, b, c)

// All of the below call `foo(1, 2, 3)`, and print '1 2 3'
foo(...[1, 2, 3]) // unrolls each list element as an argument
foo(...[1, 2], 3) // they can be used with normal arguments, in any order
foo(...[], 1, ...[2], 3, ...[]) // An empty iterable is treated as adding no new arguments
```

Finally, in addition to argument unrolling in function calls, function declarations support [pattern matching](#pattern-matching) as arguments. An argument can be directly defined as a pattern variable, for example:

```rust
fn(pair) {
    let x, y = pair
}
// is identical to
fn ((x, y)) {
    //...
}
```

In addition to this, they support bare `*` arguments like in Python. These must be the last argument in the function, and they collect all arguments into a vector when called:

```rust
// Note that `b` will be a vector of all arguments excluding the first
// It may be empty
fn foo(a, *b) -> print(a, ...b)

foo('hello') // prints 'hello'
foo('hello', 'world') // prints 'hello world'
foo('hello', 'world', 'and', 'others') // prints 'hello world and others'
```

#### Closures

Functions can reference local and global variables outside themselves, mutate them, and assign to them. Closures are able to reference and mutate captured variables, even after they have fallen out of scope of the original declaration.

```rust
fn make_box() {
    let x = 'hello'
    fn foo() -> x = 'goodbye'
    fn bar() -> x.print
    (foo, bar)
}
let foo, bar = make_box()

bar() // prints 'hello'
foo()
bar() // prints 'goodbye'
```

Variables declared in loops are captured each iteration of the loop. So the following code:

```rust
let numbers = []
for i in range(5) {
    numbers.push(fn() -> i)
}
numbers . map(fn(f) -> f()) . print
```

Will print the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, as intuitively expected.


### Control Structures

Cordy has a number of procedural style control structures, some familiar from C, Python, or Rust.

`loop` is a simple infinite loop, which must be terminated via the use of `break` (which exits the loop), or `return`:

```rust
loop {
    // statements
}
```

`while` is a conditional loop which evaluates so long as the expression returns truthy:

```rust
while condition {
    // statements
}
```

Like in Python, it can have an optional `else`, which will only be entered if a `break` statement was **not** encountered.

```java
while condition {
    // statements
} else {
    // only if no `break`
}
```

`do-while` is a variant of the above which runs statements first, then evaluates the loop

```java
do {
    // statements
} while condition
```

Like a typical `while` loop, it can also have an optional `else` block, which will only be entered if a `break` statement was **not** encountered.

```java
do {
    // statements
} while condition else {
    // only if no `break`    
}
```

Note that the `while condition` can be omitted entirely, in which case the `do { }` statement functions as a single scoped block, that also supports `break` (jump to the end of the block) and `continue` (jump to the top of the block) semantics.

`for-in` is a loop which iterates through a collection or string, yielding elements from the collection each iteration.

```rust
// declares `x` local to the loop
for x in collection {
    // statements
}
```

Note: `break` and `continue` can be used in all loop-like structures, which will exit the loop (`break`), or jump to the top of the next iteration of the loop (`continue`)

Finally, `if`, `else`, `elif` perform control flow not in expressions:

```rust
if condition1 {
    // statements
} elif condition2 {
    // statements
} else {
    // statements
}
```

Note that `if`, `else` with `{` curly brackets `}` are **not** expressions, and thus don't produce a value, however the `if`, `then`, `else` block is, and so **does** produce a value.

### Collection Types

In addition to primitive types, Cordy supports a number of mutable collection types. These are:

- `list`: A list of arbitrary type objects. It is implemented with a ring buffer, and so supports O(1) push front and back.
  - List literals can be declared with `[` square `]` brackets.
  - Lists can be accessed using array syntax, i.e. `my_list[1]`
  - Negative indexes wrap to the end of the list, i.e. `my_list[-1]` is the last element in the list
  - Lists (and strings) can also be sliced via `list[start:stop:step]`, using Python-like slicing mechanics, i.e. `my_list[2:]` takes everything after the first two elements.

```rust
let my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

- `set`: A hash set with unique elements, and O(1) `in` checks.
- `dict`: A hash map, with O(1) element lookup, and optional support for default values.
  - Accessing and mutating the `dict` can be done with array-like syntax:

```rust
let my_dict = dict()
my_dict['hello'] = 'world'
my_dict['hello'] . print
```

- `heap`: A min-heap, implemented as a binary heap, with O(log n) access to the minimum element.
- `vector`: A `list` like data type, but with a fixed length, and where all operations behave in an element-wise fashion.
  - Operating on a vector and a constant will apply the constant to each element of the vector:
  - Vectors can be declared in literals like lists, but with `(` parenthesis `)`.
  - Single argument vectors require a trailing comma (i.e. `(1,)`, not `(1)`)

```
>>> (1,)
(1)
>>> (1, 2, 3)
(1, 2, 3)
>>> (1, 2, 3) * (2, 4, 6)
(2, 8, 18)
>>> (1, 2, 3) * 3
(3, 6, 9)
```

### Pattern Matching

Variable declarations, both in `let` statements, and in the declaration of a `for-in` loop, support pattern matching / destructuring. This takes the form of mirroring the iterable-like structure, like Python:

```rust
// multiple variables 'unpack' the list
let x, y, z = [1, 2, 3]

// using '*' indicates it should collect the remaining items
let first, *rest = [1, 2, 3, 4]

// '*' can be used in the middle too!
let front, *middle, back = [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Patterns can be nested using `(` parenthesis `)`
let a, (b, c), d = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

// Any values which wish to be ignored can be replaced with `_`
let _, _, x, _ = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Pattern matching is also supported within function arguments:

```rust
// This function:
fn flip((x, y)) -> (y, x)

// Is semantically identical to this one
fn flip(pair) {
    let x, y = pair
    return (y, x)
}
```

And within expressions, if all the variables are declared:

```rust
let a, b, c

a = b, c = (1, 2) // assigns a = (1, 2), b = 1, c = 2
```

### Decorators

Named functions can optionally be *decorated*, which is a way to modify the function in-place, without having to reassign to it. A decorator consists of a `@` followed by an expression, before the function is declared:

```rust
@memoize
fn fib(n) -> if n <= 1 then 1 else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

This can be understood as the following:

```rust
fn fib(n) -> if n <= 1 then 1 else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
fib = memoize(fib)
```

Decorators can be chained - the innermost decorators will apply first, then the outermost ones. They can also be attached to anonymous functions. The expression of a decorator must resolve to a function, which takes in the original function as an argument, and outputs a new value - most typically a function, but it doesn't need to. For example:

```rust
fn run(f) -> f()

@run
fn do_stuff() { print('hello world') } // prints 'hello world' immediately, and assigns `do_stuff` to `nil`
```

### Assertions

The `assert` keyword can be used to raise an error, or assert a condition is true. Note that runtime errors in cordy are **unrecoverable**, meaning if this assertion fails, the program will effectively call `exit`. An assert statement consists of `assert <expression>`, optionally followed by `: <expression>`, where the second expression will be used in the error message.

```java
assert false // Errors with 'Assertion Failed: nil'

assert false : 'Oh no!' // Errors with 'Assertion Failed: Oh no!
```

Assertions will point to the expression in question being asserted:

```
Assertion Failed: message goes here
  at: line 1 (<test>)
  
1 | assert false : 'message goes here'
2 |        ^^^^^
```

### Structs

A `struct` is a user definable type which is able to have named fields. It can be declared much like a function, with the keyword `struct`, followed by the struct name, and then the field names in `(` parenthesis `)`. Structs have a few important properties:

- A struct can only be declared as a global variable, and thus can be referenced from anywhere in the program.
- The struct name can be invoked as a function, which creates a new instance of the struct with the provided default values for each field.
- Structs `typeof`, `is`, and `==` operators treat different structs as entirely different types.

Examples:

```rust
// An empty struct with no fields.
struct Empty()

// The only instance of Empty() that can be created
let empty = Empty()

// A struct with two fields `x` and `y`
struct Point2D(x, y)

// prints `Point2D(x=3, y=4)`
let pos_3_4 = Point2D(3, 4)
pos_3_4 . print
```

In order to access the field of a struct, the `->` operator can be used. This *can* be partially right evaluated, i.e. `->foo`. Note that the name of a field must be declared before it can be used, but unlike variables and functions, the name of a field can shadow other variables and native function names.

```rust
struct Foo(bar, baz)

let foo = Foo('bar', 'baz')

foo->bar . print // prints 'bar'

let get_baz = (->baz)
get_baz(foo) . print // prints 'baz'
```
